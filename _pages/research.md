## Research Interests

Machine Learning, Pattern Recognition, Multi-resolution Sensor Fusion, Target Detection, Dimensionality Reduction and Manifold Learning, Learning from Imprecise and Uncertain Labels, Weak Learning, Multiple Instance Learning, Metric Embedding

## Summary
I currently conduct research in the [Machine Learning and Sensing Lab](https://faculty.eng.ufl.edu/machine-learning/) (MLSL) at the University of Florida.  Our lab is dedicated to advancing methods for the analysis of remotely-sensed data.  Presently, I am funded by the Army Research Office to develop Machine Learning algorithms for target detection and sensor fusion.  For the remainder of my PhD studies, I plan to investigate methods for discriminative manifold embedding which learn from weakly-labeled training data.  My research is applicable to a broad range of tasks, including: target recognition in hyperspectral imagery, self-driving vehicles, medical diagnosis, land-use classification, manufacturing, meteorology, environmental monitoring, economic forecasting and more.
