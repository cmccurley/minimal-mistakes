title: "About Me"
---

I am a PhD student working in [Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) at the [University of Florida](https://www.ece.ufl.edu/), advised by [Dr. Alina Zare](https://faculty.eng.ufl.edu/machine-learning/machine-learning-sensing-lab/).  My current research interests include multi-sensor, multi-resolution fusion using uncertain and ambiguously-labeled data, specifically, through the utilization of [manifold learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nonlinear_dimensionality_reduction).

I have been blessed during my graduate studies to be funded by the Army's Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD).  So far I have worked on developing algorithms for explosive hazard detection and aided target recognition.  Throughout this work I have been able to explore areas such as sensor fusion, background modeling, dictionary learning, target detection/classification, manifold learning, and learning from weakly-labeled data.

Before moving to Florida, I completed a Bachelor's of Science degree in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Mathematics at Oklahoma State University (go Pokes!).

Outside of Machine Learning, I enjoy road cycling, golfing, playing guitar for my church, and spending time with my twin brother.
