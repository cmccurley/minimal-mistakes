## Research Interests

Machine Learning, Pattern Recognition, Multi-resolution Sensor Fusion, Dimensionality Reduction and Manifold Learning, Learning from Imprecise and Uncertain Labels, Target Detection

## Summary
I currently conduct research in the [Machine Learning and Sensing Lab](https://faculty.eng.ufl.edu/machine-learning/) (MLSL) at the University of Florida.  Our lab is dedicated to advancing methods for the analysis of remotely-sensed data.  I have been funded by the Army Research Office during my PhD work to develop Machine Learning algorithms for target detection and sensor fusion.  For the remainder of my PhD studies, I plan to investigate methods for discriminative manifold learning which consider uncertain and imprecise ground-truth.  My research is applicable to a broad range of tasks, including: target recognition in hyperspectral imagery, self-driving vehicles, medical diagnosis, land-use classification, manufactoring, meteorology, environmental monitoring, economic forecasting and more.
